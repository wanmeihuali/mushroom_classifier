# Mushroom classification Android application

## Overview

This is the final project for COMP 576 at Rice University. It is modified from the example application for [TensorFlow Lite](https://tensorflow.org/lite)
on Android. It uses an inception model to continuously classify the mushroom it sees from the device's back camera.
Inference is performed using the TensorFlow Lite Java API. 

These instructions walk you through building and
running the demo on an Android device. For an explanation of the source, see
[TensorFlow Lite Android image classification example](https://www.tensorflow.org/lite/models/image_classification/android).
