# Mushroom classification Android application

## Overview

This is the final project for COMP 576 at Rice University. It is modified from the example application for [TensorFlow Lite](https://tensorflow.org/lite)
on Android. It uses an inception model to continuously classify the mushroom it sees from the device's back camera.
Inference is performed using the TensorFlow Lite Java API. 

For an explanation of the original tensorflow example, see
[TensorFlow Lite Android image classification example](https://github.com/tensorflow/examples/tree/master/lite/examples/image_classification/android).

This is also my first andriod app. So, do not expect too much.

## demo for the app:
